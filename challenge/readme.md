a challenge

A program that enters a number of days, and it returns the date after the number of days you entered ðŸ™‚

  For example, if you enter 10 days, the date will be 1-2-2023

But not any solution I want is the best solution, provided that you do not use ready-made functions, only a function that gives the current time
